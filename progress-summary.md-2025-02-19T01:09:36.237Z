This commit integrates Clerk.js for user authentication.  Key changes include:

* **Code Structure:**  The `layout.tsx` file now wraps the application's content within a `<ClerkProvider>`, enabling Clerk's authentication context.  The `header.tsx` component now includes a Clerk `<UserButton>`.

* **Logic:** Authentication is enforced in `layout.tsx`; if a user is not authenticated, they are redirected to `/sign-in`.  `page.tsx` now logs whether a user is logged in or out using the Clerk authentication context.

* **Functionality:**  The application now has user authentication and authorization via Clerk.js, providing a user button in the header.
