This commit integrates Clerk.js for user authentication.  Key changes include:

* **Code Structure:**  The `layout.tsx` file now wraps the entire application within a `<ClerkProvider>`, handling authentication context.  Several components now import and use Clerk's authentication components (`SignedIn`, `UserButton`).
* **Authentication Logic:**  A redirect to `/sign-in` is implemented in `layout.tsx` if a user isn't authenticated.  The `page.tsx` file now logs whether a user is logged in or out using Clerk's authentication context.
* **Functionality:**  A user button is added to the header (`header.tsx`) for user management functionalities (only visible when signed in).
