This commit integrates Clerk.js for user authentication.  The `layout.tsx` file now wraps the app with a `ClerkProvider`, enforcing authentication by redirecting unauthenticated users to a sign-in page.  The `page.tsx` file includes authentication checks and logging. The `header.tsx` component displays a Clerk user button for authenticated users.  No significant changes were made to the application's core structure or memory display functionality.
