This commit integrates Clerk.js for user authentication.  Key changes include:

* **Added Clerk.js:** The `@clerk/nextjs` package was added for authentication and user management.  Clerk components are now used throughout the application (`ClerkProvider`, `SignInButton`, `SignedIn`, `UserButton`).

* **Authentication Logic:**  The `layout.tsx` now redirects unauthenticated users to a sign-in page (`/sign-in`).  `page.tsx` now logs whether a user is signed in or not.

* **UI Changes:**  The header now includes a Clerk user button for authenticated users, replacing a placeholder element.

No significant changes were made to the core application logic or data structures beyond the integration of the authentication system.
