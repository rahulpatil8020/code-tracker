This commit integrates Clerk.js for user authentication.  The `layout.tsx` file now wraps the app in a `ClerkProvider`,  redirects unauthenticated users to a sign-in page, and includes a user button in the header (`header.tsx`).  The `page.tsx` file now logs user login status.  No significant changes to core application logic or structure besides the authentication integration are present.
