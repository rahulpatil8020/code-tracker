This commit integrates Clerk.js for authentication.  Key changes include:

* **Authentication:** Added Clerk.js for user authentication and authorization.  The application now redirects to a sign-in page if the user is not authenticated.

* **UI Updates:**  The header now includes a Clerk user button for user management (sign in/out, profile).

* **Code Structure:**  Clerk provider wrapped the main application layout.  This change affects the entire application's rendering.

* **Conditional Rendering:**  Pages now conditionally render content based on user authentication status.

Minor logging statements were added for debugging purposes.
