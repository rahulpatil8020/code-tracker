This commit integrates Clerk.js for user authentication.  Key changes include:

* **Authentication:** Added Clerk.js provider to handle user authentication and authorization.  Authentication is now enforced at the root layout level, redirecting unauthorized users to a sign-in page.

* **UI Updates:**  The header component now includes a Clerk.js `UserButton` for user account management.  Conditional rendering based on login status is implemented in several components.

* **Code Structure:**  The `ClerkProvider` wraps the main application layout, and authentication logic is implemented using `auth` and `currentUser` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`.


Minor logging changes were also made to track user login status.
