This commit integrates Clerk.js for user authentication.  Key changes include:

* **Code Structure:**  The `layout.tsx` file now wraps the application content with a `ClerkProvider`, handling authentication.  The `page.tsx` and `header.tsx` components now include Clerk authentication components (`SignedIn`, `UserButton`).
* **Authentication Logic:**  Authentication is implemented using Clerk.js's client and server components.  Unauthenticated users are redirected to the `/sign-in` page.  The `page.tsx` file now logs whether a user is logged in or not.
* **Functionality:**  The header now displays a user profile button when logged in.  The application now has user authentication.

Minor UI/UX changes were also made.
