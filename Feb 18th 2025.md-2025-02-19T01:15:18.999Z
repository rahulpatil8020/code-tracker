This commit integrates Clerk.js, an authentication service, into the Next.js application.  Key changes include:

* **Authentication:** Added ClerkProvider to wrap the application, enabling user authentication and authorization.  Route protection was implemented, redirecting unauthenticated users to a sign-in page.  User information is now accessible throughout the application.

* **UI Updates:** The header component now displays a Clerk UserButton for user management (login/logout, profile).

* **Code Structure:** Minimal structural changes, primarily adding Clerk-related imports and components within the existing layout and page components.  A conditional rendering based on user authentication status has been added to several components.

In short, this commit adds user authentication and authorization using Clerk.js, enhancing security and user experience.
