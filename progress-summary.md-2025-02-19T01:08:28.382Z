This commit integrates Clerk.js for user authentication.  Key changes include:

* **Authentication:** Added Clerk.js for user authentication and authorization.  The app now redirects unauthenticated users to a sign-in page.  User authentication status is checked on page load and in the header.

* **Code Structure:**  The `layout.tsx` file now wraps the entire application within a `<ClerkProvider>`, integrating Clerk's authentication context.  Several components now import and use Clerk's React components (`SignedIn`, `UserButton`).

* **UI Changes:** A user button is added to the header, replacing a placeholder element.  The `Home` page now logs whether a user is logged in or out to the console for debugging.


Minor UI/UX changes and logging additions were also included.
