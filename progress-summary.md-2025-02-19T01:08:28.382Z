This commit integrates Clerk.js for user authentication.  Key changes include:

* **Added Clerk.js:** The `@clerk/nextjs` package was added for authentication.  The application now uses ClerkProvider to wrap the main layout and utilizes Clerk's `SignInButton`, `SignedIn`, `auth`, and `currentUser` components and functions for user authentication and authorization.

* **Authentication Logic:**  A redirect is implemented to `/sign-in` if a user is not authenticated.  Conditional rendering based on user authentication status (`userId`) is added to some components.

* **UI Changes:** A `UserButton` from Clerk.js is integrated into the header for user account management.

The `page.tsx` component now logs whether a user is logged in.  Minor UI adjustments were also made, but the core changes center around adding and using Clerk.js for authentication.
