This commit integrates Clerk.js for user authentication.  Key changes include:

* **Authentication:** Added Clerk.js provider to handle user authentication and authorization.  The application now redirects unauthenticated users to a sign-in page.

* **UI Updates:**  The header now includes a Clerk UserButton for user management (sign in/out, profile).

* **Conditional Rendering:** Some components now conditionally render based on user authentication status.

* **Project Dependencies:** The `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files reflect the addition of Clerk.js as a dependency.
