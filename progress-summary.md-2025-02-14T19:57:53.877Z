This commit integrates Clerk.js for user authentication.  Key changes include:

* **Authentication:** Added Clerk.js for user authentication and authorization.  The application now redirects unauthenticated users to a sign-in page.

* **UI Updates:** The header now includes a Clerk user button for user management (sign in/out, profile).

* **Code Structure:**  The `RootLayout` component now wraps the application's content within a `ClerkProvider`, and conditional rendering based on authentication status is implemented.

* **Logging:** Added console logging to indicate user login/logout status in the `page.tsx` file.  This is likely temporary debugging code.  No significant functional change aside from logging.
